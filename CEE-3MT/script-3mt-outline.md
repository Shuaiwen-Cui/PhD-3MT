## Title
**Distributed Edge Intelligence Enabling Framework for Internet-of-Things-based Structural Health Monitoring - TinySHM**

## Opening
- **Infrastructure health** is of **vital importance** to our society—and to everyone here.
- I believe most of us remember last year the **MRT Green Line** shut down for a few days due to faults. This example exactly shows why monitoring our infrastructure is so critical. 

## Research Background and Problem
- **Current Approach:**
  - We use the **Internet of Things (IoT)** to monitor infrastructure.
  - **Sensors** collect data, which is gathered by a **gateway** and sent to a remote **cloud server** for analysis.
- **Challenges:**
  - The cloud’s distance causes **high latency** and **power consumption** for sensor communications.
- **Our Solution:**
  - Shift computation to the **edge**, processing data closer to the sensors for **low latency** and **low power use**.
  - Integrate **AI techniques** on edge devices for real-time decision-making.
- **Summary:** Our research leverages **edge computing** for **timely** and **accurate decision making for structural health monitoring**.

## Research Methods
- **Platform Development:**
  - We built a **microcontroller-based edge computing platform** with five subsystems:
    - **Main control**
    - **Sensing**
    - **Communication**
    - **Interaction**
    - **Power management**
- **Software Architecture:**
  - Organized into **four layers**:
    - **Hardware**
    - **Driver**
    - **Middleware**
    - **Application**
- **Objective:** Develop a **toolbox** (middleware library) for **AI-powered structural health monitoring at the edge**.
- **Key Focus Areas:**
  - **High-quality sensing**
  - **Damage localization**
  - **Damage evaluation**
- A standout feature is the **onboard AI** that enables local, real-time data analysis.

## Use Cases
- Our system is under active development and already shows promise:
  - **Data-driven structural condition assessments**
  - **Sudden damage detection**
  - **Real-time event classification**
- These cases highlight its potential for **real-world applications**.

## Conclusion and Outlook
- In summary, our goal is to create a **distributed edge intelligence framework** for **IoT-based structural health monitoring**.
- This enables **timely** and **accurate decision-making**.
- Looking ahead, we plan to evolve our prototype into a **robust, user-friendly product** with additional features.
